Syntax in JavaScript.
=====================
var x; // declaring a variable.

x = 3 + y; // assigning a value to the variable x

boo (); // Calling function with empty parameters.
xyz (10, 20); // Calling function xyz with two parameters.
obj.foo (); // Calling method foo of object obj.

// A conditional statement.
if (x == y) { 
    // do something.
}

// Definition function xyz with two parameters are a, b
function xyz (a,b) {
return a+b;
}

Note that the three different uses of equal sign

1. A single equal sign (=) is used to assign a value to a variable.
2. A double equal sing (==) is used to compare two values.
3. A triple equal sign (===) is used to compare two values along with the type of operands.

Statements Versus Expressions.
==============================
To understand JavaScript's syntax, you should know that it has two major syntactic categories: Statements and Expressions.

1. Statements "do things". A program is a sequence of statements, which ends with the semicolon (;), which is optional. Here is the example of the statement, which declares a variable foo. in the program.
        var foo; // Declare a variable foo call it as a statement.

2. Expression produce values. They are function arguments, the right side of an assignment. Here is the example

        3 * 7; // It produce the value called it by Expression.
        var x = 3 * 7; // Here the expression should be right side of an assignment. Calculate two values and produce some calculated value and assign it to the variable.

    JavaScript has two different ways to do if-then-else as a statement:

            var x = 5;
            var y = 2;
            if ( y >= 0) {
                x = y;
            } else {
                x = -y;
            }
        or as an expression:

            var x = y >= 0 ? y : -y; // Here the expression is the right side of single equal sign operator.

            foo (7, 9); // The hole line is the statement, but the function call foo return some expected value which is called an expression.

Semicolons
==========
    Semicolons are optional in JavaScript. Semicolons terminate statements, but not blocks. There is one case where we will see the semicolon after the block: a function expression is an expression that ends with a block.

            var x = 3 * 7;

            var f = function () {
                // An anonymous function is terminates by semicolon.
            };

Variables and Assignments
=========================
    Variables in JavaScript are declared before they are used.

        var foo;

    We can declare a variable and assign a value to the variable at the same time.

        var foo = "declare and assigned";

        var age = 29;

    We can also assign a value to the existing variable:
        
        var age = 24;

Compound Assignment Operators
=============================
    There are compound assignment operators such as +=. The following two statements are equal.

        x += 1;

        or

        x = x + 1;

Primitive values Versus Objects
===============================

    1. The primitive values are booleans, numbers, strings, null and undefined.
    2. All other values are objects.

    A major difference between the two is how they are compared; each object has a unique identity and is only (strictly) equal to itself.

        > var obj1 = {} // an empty object.
        > var obj2 = {} // another empty object.

        > obj1 === obj2
        false

        > obj1 === obj1
        true

    In contrast, primitive values encoding the same value are consider the same.

        > var primi1 = 123;
        > var primi2 = 123;

        > primi1 === primi2
        true

        > primi1 === primi1
        true

    Primitive Values

        The following are all of the primitive values.

        1. Boolean : true or false
        2. Number : 179 or 1.413
        3. String : "abc", 'xyz'
        4. Two 'nonvalues' : undefined and null.

    Primitives have the following characteristics
            
        Compared by value.

            The content is compared.
            > 3 === 3
            true

            > 'abc' === 'abc'
            true

            Always immutable.
                Properties can't be added, changed and deleted.

                var str = 'abc';

                > str.length = 1;  // try to changes the property length.
                > str.length;
                3.               // no effect.

                > str.foo = 3; // try to create a new property as 'foo'
                > str.foo     //  no effect, unknown property
                undefined.   //   Regarding an unknown property always returns undefined.

    Objects

        All non-primitive values are objects. The most common kinds of objects are :

        1. Plain Objects, which can be created by object literals.
            
            {
                firstName: "John",
                lastName: "Smith"
            }

            The preceding object has two properties: the value of property firstName is "John" and the value of property lastName is "Smith".

        2. Arrays, which can be created by array literals.

            ['apple', 'grape', 'orange']

            The preceding array has three elements that can be accessed via numeric indices. For example the index of 'apple' is 0.

        3. Regular Expressions, which can be created by regular expressions.
            
            /^a+b$/


        Object have the following characteristics.

            Compared by reference
                Identities are compared. every value has its own identity.

                > {} === {} // two different empty object.
                false

                > var obj1 = {}; // declare a variable and assign an empty object to that variable.
                > var obj2 = obj1; // assign an obj1 identity value to the obj2 variable.

                > obj1 === obj2
                true

            Mutable by default.
                You can normally freely change, add and delete properties. For example

                > var obj1 = {}; // declare a variable and assign an empty object to that variable.
                > obj1.foo = 123; // add property 'foo'
                > obj1.foo
                123

    undefined and null

        Most of the programming languages have values denoting (indicate)
        missing information. JavaScript has two such "nonvalues", undefined
        and null.

        undefined means "no value". Uninitialized variables are undefined.

            > var foo;
            > console.log(foo);
            undefined

        Missing parameters are undefined:

            > function foo (x) { return x }
            > console.log ( foo() );
            undefined

        If you read a nonexistent property, we get undefined.
            
            > var obj = {};
            > console.log (obj.foo); // foo is nonexistent property here.
            undefined

        undefined and null have no properties, not even standard methods such
        as toString () etc.
