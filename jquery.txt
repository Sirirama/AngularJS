1(Q). Given the following HTML:
    <div id="expander"></div>

and the following CSS:
    div#expander {
        height: 100px;
        width: 100px;
        background-color: blue
    }

Write code in jQuery to animate the #expander div.expanding it from 100px x
100px to 200px x 200px over the course of three seconds ?

A) This could be done in jQuery as follows.
    $('div#expander').on('mouseover', function (){
        $('#expander').animate({width: 200px, height: 200px}, 3000);
    })

    what is animate () function jQuery ?

    The animate () function performs a custom animation of a set of CSS
    properties. This method changes from one state to another state with CSS
    styles. The CSS property value is changed gradually, to create an animated
    effect.

    Only numeric values can be animated (like margin: 30px). String values
    cannot be animated (like background-color: red), except for the strings
    "hide", "show" and "toggle". These values allow hiding and showing the
    animated element.


2(Q). Which of the two lines of code below is more efficient ? 

    document.getElementById("logo");

            or
    $("#logo");

A) The first line of code, which is pure JavaScript without jQuery, is more
efficient and faster. Executing the second line of code, which is jQuery, will
trigger a call to the JavaScript version.

jQuery is built on top of JavaScript and uses its methods under the hood to
make DOM manipulation easier, at the cost of some performance overhead. It is
a good idea to remember that jQuery is not always better than plain old
JavaScript. Always consider whether using jQuery is really provides a useful
advantage for your project.
